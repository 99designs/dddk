Do you have lots of services? Do you wish they had a consistent set of monitors, alerting to
the right teams? What about SLOs automatically generated containing all serious issues? And to dump
those straight onto dashboards per app, or rollup stats for the team/company?

Well wish no more! The Datadog Dev Kit does this for you using a simple typescript CLI that gives you full
autocomplete as you describe your services.
